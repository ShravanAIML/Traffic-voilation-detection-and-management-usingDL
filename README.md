The project titled "Deep Learning-Driven Automated Traffic Violation Detection and Predictive Traffic Management" focuses on building an intelligent system that uses deep learning to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency. Leveraging YOLOv12, the system performs real-time object detection on video footage to identify vehicles, traffic signals, lane markings, and detect violations such as red light jumping, wrong-lane driving, and the absence of helmets or seatbelts. 
To predict upcoming traffic congestion, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is trained on historical traffic data derived from the video stream, enabling the system to forecast congestion 15 minutes in advance. Additionally, CNN or RCNN models are integrated where needed to extract finer features, such as recognizing number plates or traffic signs. Once a violation is detected, the system uses OCR to extract the vehicle number and automatically generates a fine by referencing the vehicle database. 
It also includes an alert system that notifies traffic authorities of predicted congestions or violations, ensuring timely intervention. Implemented in Google Colab with tools like OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and evaluation metrics like mAP and RMSE, this solution contributes to the development of smart, AI-driven traffic management systems in urban environments.
